Wrap Operator extension README
==============================

=== Description

Essentially, this is a simple wrapper operator to directly call any system and user-defined functions in template.

It does not concern me much if doing so is good idea or 'pfui' as someone said on the #ezpublish channel.  Undoubtedly
care has to be taken to avoid security and caching problems, etc.  But it makes life a lot easier for me because i
dont have to write unexisting text processing functions in template language and dont need to set up separate
extension to every small operator i need.  It's a swiss army knife - you can cut your hand but noone is forcing you to :)

    
=== Thoughts

I am not sure exactly what datatypes can be passed to functions from template like this.  Should work ok for
integers, strings and boolean i think.  If you are more informed about ez internals, please comment.

Using wrap_user_func with return_output=true() should enable easy embedding of existing php applications in
templates, called through the user function.  I have tested just simple test case but maybe someone can think of something
more useful and post specific instructions..

Comments and suggestions for improvement are very welcome.  Either post on forum or talk to zurgutt on #ezpublish irc
channel on irc.freenode.net.
