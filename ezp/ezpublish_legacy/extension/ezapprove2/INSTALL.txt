*Installation:

1. Copy this folder to <ez publish root>/extension/ezapprove2
2. Apply SQL in sql/<sql server>/schema.sql
3. Activate the ezapprove2 extension.
4. Clear ini, ini-override and tpl-override cache.

5. You must have a cronjob script which runs the workflow cronjob.
Easiest way to set this up is to add the following to
settings/override/cronjob.ini.append.php (create the file if it does
not exist):

[CronjobPart-workflow]
Scripts[]=workflow.php

Then run the following command at regular intervals from the eZ publish root directory:

php runcronjobs.php workflow


* How to use:

After installing the extension, go to the administration interface

Simple usage:
1. Go to setup -> workflows
2. Click on "Standard" workflow group
3. Click "New workflow"
4. Add a name like "My approval workflow"
5. Select "Event/Approve2" and click "Add event"
6. Select appropriate options for approval workflow

7. Go to setup -> triggers
8. Select in "content publish before" the "My approval workflow" and click "Apply changes"

For the "editor":
After he/she have edited content, it will now be sent for approval.
While it is awaiting approval, it will be visible in "My pending items" and
"Collaboration" in "My account"

For the "approver":
The content waiting for approval will be shown in the "Collaboration" part of "My account"


More advanced setups with approval of only some classes and so on,
can be done with the "multiplexer". See
http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_0/reference/workflow_events/multiplexer


Also note that you can get notification-email upon updates. You set this up by going to
 "My account" -> "My notification settings". Check "Approval2" in
"Collaboration notification" and click "Apply"

Note: This requires the notification cronjob to run.
