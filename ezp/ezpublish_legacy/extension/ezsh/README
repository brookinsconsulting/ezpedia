With this extension it is possible to highlight the syntax of all common languages including PHP, C, CPP, Java, CSS, XHTML and more, including eZ own .tpl and .ini files.

It is a port of the "eZ Syntax Highlighter" extension originally written by Lukasz Serwatka, updated to the latest eZ Publish and GeSHi versions.

It includes GeSHi files for eZ own .tpl and .ini syntaxes, that can be used in other applications outside of eZ Publish.

Three possibilities are offered to highlight code:
. via specific classes for the "literal" tag in the online editor
. via the "ezsh" template operator
. via a module view (geshi/highlight) that can be used to highlight any file within the eZ Publish root directory

A php script is included to update the included content.ini file with all the languages known to GeSHi after eg. an upgrade.
