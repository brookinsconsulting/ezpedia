With this extension you can highlight the syntax of all common languages including PHP, C, CPP, Java, CSS, XHTML and more, including eZ own .tpl and .ini files.

It is a port of the "eZ Syntax Highlighter" extension originally written by Lukasz Serwatka, updated to the latest eZ Publish and Geshi versions.

It includes geshi files for eZ own .tpl and .ini syntaxes, that can be used in other applications outside of eZ Publish.
