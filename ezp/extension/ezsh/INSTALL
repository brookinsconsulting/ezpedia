ACTIVATION:
-----------

1 - activate the extension following the standard eZ Publish procedures
    (remember to regenerate the ezp_extension.php autoload file)

CONFIGURATION:
--------------

2 - for highlighting of source code in the Online Editor:

    Many new styles are added for the "literal" tag.
    Edit the settings/content.ini.append.php file to remove unused languages
    if you find the list too long


3 - for highlighting of complete files via module/view:

    eZGeshi allows to display highligted any dource file that is part of the local
    eZ Publish installation, and with proper configuration, even of source code
    files that are available on the webserver.
    Grant permissions on the geshi/view_ezpublish_source or geshi/view_any_source
    functions to those users that will be allowed to see highlighted files via
    the geshi/highlight view.
    Use the GeneralSettings/Blacklist parameter in ezsh.ini to limit display
    of sources to a given set of files/directories.

    NB: to see highlited content in rich text or via the template operator ezsh
    there is no need to set any specific permissions
    NBB: the second permisison allows highlighting of ANY file on the server !!!
         We strongly recommend using open_basedir limitation in php.ini along with it
         (also to make it work, AllowAbsolutePaths has to enabled in ezsh.ini)

    To test access to the geshi/highlight view, use an url like the following ones:
    http://ezp/index.php/my_site_admin/geshi/highlight/design/standard/templates/node/view/full.tpl
    http://ezp/index.php/my_site_admin/geshi/highlight/settings/override/site.ini.append.php


4 - to enhance the Debug Output:

    eZGeshi enhances the standard debug output of eZ Publish by adding links to
    the source code of all templates and php files that are mentioned in it.
    To enable this functionality, edit the design.ini file within eZGeshi and
    uncomment the FrontendJavaScriptList/BackendJavaScriptList lines; also make
    sure the user who will use this has been granted access permissions on the
    geshi/view_ezpublish_source view.

    NB: the enhancement of debug output is done via jQuery. If you are not using
    jQuery in your website, enabling this will have a (slight) impact on
    performances, as the jQuery library will have to be loaded. It is recommended
    in such case not to enable this configuration for production servers.

    If you are displaying the new "list of included php files" in the debug output,
    in order to make work the links to highlight those file, you will have to set
    AllowAbsolutePaths to enabled in ezsh.ini.
    Take care about the security implications of doing this.
